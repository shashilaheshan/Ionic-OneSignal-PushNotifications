#### Used Cordova plugins
In case that the required Cordova plugins are not installed while installing NodeJS dependencies, Cordova's command mentioned previously can be used to install the following plugins:

* **cordova-plugin-device** - This plugin defines a global device object, which describes the device's hardware and software.
* **cordova-plugin-console** - This plugin is meant to ensure that console.log() is as useful as it can be. It adds additional function for iOS, Ubuntu, Windows Phone 8, and Windows.
* **cordova-plugin-whitelist** - This plugin implements a whitelist policy for navigating the application webview on Cordova 4.0.
* **cordova-plugin-splashscreen** - This plugin is required to work with splash screens. This plugin displays and hides a splash screen during application launch.
* **cordova-plugin-statusbar** - Used to customize the iOS and Android StatusBar, alter the appearance of the status bar (color/style).
* **ionic-plugin-keyboard** - It provides functions to make interacting with the keyboard easier, and fires events to indicate that the keyboard will hide/show.
